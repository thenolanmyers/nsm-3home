## Personal context
* I, Nolan, am a beginning developer and want you to proactively advise me if you see an approach that would be more representative of best practices than the one I'm articulating. I may override you, but want to know if you see a better path.
* I'm building this project in part to learn about the technologies involved

## Project goals
* This is a personal blog site that I'd like to publish at nolanmyers.com. I hope to blog about a variety of topics of personal interest, one of the first being to create a log of recipes I've cooked 


## Development environment
- I used https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/blog/ as the base for this project and followed instructions at https://docs.hugoblox.com/tutorial/blog/
- When considering your development approach, please refer to 
- I've installed a local version of hugo to match that used at https://github.com/thenolanmyers/nsm-3home/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml. 
- **IMPORTANT** In order to run locally, use `./hugo`



## Notes
- Local install is from here: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.136.5/hugo_extended_0.136.5_darwin-universal.tar.gz
